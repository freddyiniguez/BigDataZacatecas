# * In an experiment, the investigator manipulates in some way the environment she or he is studying.
# * There are so many concepts about experiments to explain, so, to do not just copy and paste it here, it is important to hit the section 3.2.

# * Observational Studies are use to determine the behaviour or relationships between variables. This means that if we want to know the relationship
# * between two or more variables, we can simple use an observational study.
# * Obviously, you don't need to manipulate the environment.
# * We can find two kinds of observational studies:
#     - Prospective: this means that the participants are tracked or followed in the future.
#     - Retrospective: this means that you collected data taking a look back in the past.

# * To know the difference between an experiment and an observational study we can simple ask these few questions:
# * (If you get a 'No' in one of these questions, the experiment cannot be performed.)
#     - Is there a control group?
#     - Is there (at least) one treatment group?
#     - Did the researcher randomly assign subjects to these groups?
#     - Did the researcher manipulate the environment in some way?
