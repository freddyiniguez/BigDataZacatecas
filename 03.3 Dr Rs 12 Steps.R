# These are an abbreviated steps from Dr. Mike Hayden (http://technology.indstate.edu/directory/haydenm.htm)' 16 steps approach:

# 1) State the overall problem and research question(s).
# 2) State technique/methodology that will be used to dra a conclusion for this research question.
# 3) Describe your population, sample, and sampling procedure.
# 4) Data collection.
# 5) Explain variables used.
# 6) State assumptions and limitations.
# 7) State the null hypothesis and allternative hypothesis.
# 8) Set and explain level of significance (alpha).
# 9) Include descriptive statistics + chats, graphs, or plots that describe your data set. 
# 10) Calculate the test statistic (T.S.).
# 11) Draw a picture, then find the p-value.
# 12) Draw conclusion, provide interpretation, and confirm with confidence interval: is p-value z a(alpha)) If so, reject the null.
